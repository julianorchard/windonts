##   readme-details.py  ---  Scrapes preamble descriptions from files.

# Copyright (c) 2023   Julian Orchard <jorchard@pm.me>

## Description:

# This is the script that generates what you might be reading *now*!

# It scrapes the `.bin/` folder and gets the text under the *'description'*
# heading (above). It's pretty simple, but nice to give an overview of
# what files are in this repo.

# Often run with a GitHub Action and the `--action` flag. See
# [.github/...](.github/workflows/main.yaml) for more!
